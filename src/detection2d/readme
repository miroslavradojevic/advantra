#classes
Critpoint2D          (PlugIn)       - uses Detector2D just to do the raw detection
Detector2D           (Java class)       : carries out the detection by calling threaded classes
Masker2D             (Thread)           : back_xy, mask_xy, criteria, i2xy, xy2i (inputs: inimg_xy)
Profiler2D           (Thread)           : prof2  (inputs: inimg_xy, xy2i, i2xy)
ProfileSpread2D
PeakExtractor2D      (Thread)           : peaks_theta, peaks_i, peaks_w, peaks_lhood (inputs: i2xy, xy2i, prof2, inimg_xy)
Delineator2D
Ncc2D
FuzzyDetector2D
Evaluator2D
Viewer2D

#features
features are in (missing values are stored as NaN):
PeakExtractor2D.peaks_lhood             float[Nlocs][4]         peaks_lhood[loc] cannot be null
Delineator2D.smoothness                 float[Nlocs][4]         smoothness[loc] can be null
Ncc2D.scores                           float[Nlocs][4]         average[loc] can be null

#.det output
main detection output file - keeps CritpointRegions and stores the directions. .det is used by Evaluator2D and Viewer2D
